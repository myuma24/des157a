                    Pidgey the pidgeon grew up on the streets, learning to survive on scraps since she was just a small hatchling.

                    Goat the bird(?) is an enigmatic character; not much is known about him except for his distinctive goat eyes, making him truly one of a kind. Armed with a baseball bat and operating on just one brain cell, he possesses a unique blend of mystery and simplicity. Goat has a 5% chance that his attacks deliver a deadly, game ending, blow.
