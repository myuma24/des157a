<!-- Project Summary: 1 sentence summary indicating which project you are updating and on which areas you plan to focus on. These include visual design, UX/UI and functionality. You must choose two, but one can be major and the other minor (or they can be equal).

Project Description: Write a brief paragraph (100 - 300 words) providing more detail on what you plan to do for the project and specifically for each of at least two of the areas of focus above. 

Expert Feedback: With whom might you share your ideas for your areas of focus to get further feedback and help you further iterate and improve the project. See below for expert feedback requirements. -->

            <h1>Project Summary</h1>
            <p>I will be updating my Game On project, focusing on visual design and functionality.</p>
            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <P>
                I plan to introduce additional graphical elements to elevate the gaming experience. Exploring dynamic animations is also on the agenda to infuse a higher level of interactivity into the game. On the functionality front, I've encountered challenges in crafting efficient and functional code. I recognize that my current code can be further improved and simplified. I would like to implement stored data functions to facilitate smoother player transitions, however, my understanding of this aspect is currently limited. I hope to grasp it more comprehensively and implement it through updates to the code. I am also hoping to recieve feedback from peer critque and implement those ideas and suggestions.
            </P>
            <h1>Expert Feedback</h1>
            <p>
                I plan to seek feedback from our class Teaching Assistants and Mo, a TA from my DES116 Visual Communications class. For more specialized feedback on functionality, I will turn to a trusted high school friend who recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Their prior assistance has been invaluable, and I am confident that their insights will contribute significantly to refining the project's functional aspects.
