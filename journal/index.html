            <h1>Design Best Practices</h1>
            <p>One of the most important design practices in HTML and CSS is keeping your code clean and as organized as possible. When coding starts to get a little long, it becomes increasingly difficult to find specific lines of code that you need. It is good to take the extra steps and add descriptive names for elements and use semantic HTML markup. Making use of indentations can also help with the flow over every section or article you're working with.</p>
            <p>Keeping the design clean and minimalistic is important, avoiding cluttered layouts or excessive use of decorative elements. This helps to improve the overall user experience and make the website more visually appealing. Typography also plays a crucial role in the design of HTML and CSS. Other general design practices is minimizing the number of objects and a screen and focusing on including only the specifics. Many online apparel stores such as <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> like to mush many categories on the front page as possible to get more consumers to click on things. To combat the large amount of content on one page, Etsy does a good job is seperating each section into its own respective containers with bold fonts whereas Amazon uses sections that just do not have enough contrast to really pay attention to it. Choosing appropriate fonts, font sizes, line spacing, and colors can greatly enhance the readability and aesthetics of a website.
            </p>
            <p>One final design practice to consider is having a user-friendly navigation, clear call-to-action buttons, and responsive design for different devices and screen sizes. A good navigation and call to call-to-action buttons allows users to travel to different parts of sites easily. Responsive design is essential so a site can appear coherent and adapt to different screen sizes. All of these design practices ensure that the website can be easily accessed and understood by users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies.
