            <h1>Visual Thinking Strategies</h1>
            <p>
                A picture is worth a thousand words. Complex ideas can be conveyed through a simple image and effectively draw out complex verbal descriptions. As a designer, the ability to critically analyze an image is a vital skill to gain. Here are some tips to gain a better understanding of visual literacy and thinking. </p>

            <p>
                Understanding the different elements and visuals of an image can also allow for a better understanding of the intended message it is trying to convey, such as visual cues, symbols, lighting, contrast, and color. Different colors can have different feelings and different symbols and imagery can trigger different feelings in emotions. The small details can really enhance an image for better or worse.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to gain a deeper understanding of an image, it is important to consider the multiple perspectives of interpretation.  An image can mean one thing to a person and completely different to another. Being about to tell these differences can avoid confusion in design. Asking different questions like “What’s going on in this picture?” can open up more questions and meanings. Introducing new ideas can identify any potential biases or agendas within an image that can influence the intended messages. Practicing these analytical skills can improve your design lenses and assist you in navigating design choices.

            <h1>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h1>
            <p>
                A modal window or dialog window is an element that sits on top of a main page with the purpose of showing additional information, grabbing a person's attention, or requesting some sort of information from a user. You've most likely come across many different forms of modal windows, for example, when you are online shopping, sites often invite users to enter an email for a discount. When using modal windows, it is important to follow these best practices.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Consider the context and purpose of the modal. Before implementing a modal window, analyze the specific context in which it will be used determine its purpose, and then relay that to the user to know what is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modal windows should enhance the user experience, not hinder it. Provide a clear and easily accessible way for users to dismiss the modal window, such as a close/escape button or a click outside the window. Having labeled and color-coordinated buttons can also greatly enhance a user's experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modal windows should also be used sparingly. Avoid overwhelming the user with too many modal windows, which can interrupt their workflow and cause frustration. Avoid making them too big or too small either. Provide clear and concise information. Avoid overcrowding the window with excessive text or unnecessary elements that may confuse the user. Modal windows should present information in a clear and concise manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ensure responsive design using modal windows. Modal windows should be designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure that the modal windows are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use appropriate contrast and colors that can make the modal window easily readable and visually appealing such as dimming the background when a modal is triggered. These are some best practices to consider when adding modal windows to your website.

            <h1>Design Best Practices</h1>
            <p>One of the most important design practices in HTML and CSS is keeping your code clean and as organized as possible. When coding starts to get a little long, it becomes increasingly difficult to find specific lines of code that you need. It is good to take the extra steps and add descriptive names for elements and use semantic HTML markup. Making use of indentations can also help with the flow over every section or article you're working with.</p>
            <p>Keeping the design clean and minimalistic is important, avoiding cluttered layouts or excessive use of decorative elements. This helps to improve the overall user experience and make the website more visually appealing. Typography also plays a crucial role in the design of HTML and CSS. Other general design practices is minimizing the number of objects and a screen and focusing on including only the specifics. Many online apparel stores such as <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> like to mush many categories on the front page as possible to get more consumers to click on things. To combat the large amount of content on one page, Etsy does a good job is seperating each section into its own respective containers with bold fonts whereas Amazon uses sections that just do not have enough contrast to really pay attention to it. Choosing appropriate fonts, font sizes, line spacing, and colors can greatly enhance the readability and aesthetics of a website.
            </p>
            <p>One final design practice to consider is having a user-friendly navigation, clear call-to-action buttons, and responsive design for different devices and screen sizes. A good navigation and call to call-to-action buttons allows users to travel to different parts of sites easily. Responsive design is essential so a site can appear coherent and adapt to different screen sizes. All of these design practices ensure that the website can be easily accessed and understood by users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies.
